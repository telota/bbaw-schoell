# BBAW Schoell

The "BBAW Schoell" font is maintained by the Digital Humanities initiative [TELOTA](http://www.bbaw.de/telota) at the [Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities](http://www.bbaw.de) in order to support various research projects with a font, that can be expanded as required and also used online in digital publications.

The font "BBAW Schoell" is mainly based on the font ["Linux Libertine"](http://libertine-fonts.org/) and includes therefore all characters of the Linux Libertine. The "Linux Libertine" was selected in a comprehensive evaluation of open source fonts in 2014 because it had the largest character set (regarding the requirements of BBAW projects) and high typographic quality. The letters of the Unicode blocks "Greek and Coptic" and "Coptic" were integrated from the OFL licensed font ["New Athena Unicode"](https://apagreekkeys.org). In addition, special Egyptian characters were designed and added for the purposes of the academic project "Structures and Transformations of the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language: Text and Knowledge Culture in Ancient Egypt".

At the moment, the font only includes the normal style. There are no other styles (e.g. italics) for the added parts. For the characters taken over unchanged from the Linux Libertine, users can find further font styles there.
