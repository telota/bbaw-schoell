# FONTLOG "BBAW Schoell"

This is the FONTLOG file for the BBAW Schoell Font and attempts to follow the recommendations at:  http://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ_web#43cecb44

## Overview

The "BBAW Schoell" font is maintained by the Digital Humanities Initiative [TELOTA](http://www.bbaw.de/telota) at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in order to support various research projects with a font, that can be expanded as required and also used online in digital publications.

The font "BBAW Schoell" is mainly based on the font ["Linux Libertine"](http://libertine-fonts.org/) and includes therefore alle characters of the Linux Libertine. The "Linux Libertine" was selected in a comprehensive evaluation of open source fonts in 2014 because it had the largest character set (regarding the requirements of the BBAW projects) and high typographic quality. The letters of the Unicode blocks "Greek and Coptic" and "Coptic" were integrated from the OFL licensed font ["New Athena Unicode"](http://apagreekkeys.org). In addition, special Egyptian characters were designed and added for the purposes of the academic project "Structures and Transformations of the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language: Text and Knowledge Culture in Ancient Egypt". 

At the moment, the font only includes the normal font style. There are no other styles (e.g. italics) for the added parts. For the letters taken over unchanged from the Linux Libertine, users can find further font styles there.
